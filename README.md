## A_Star 

- This code include A-Star algorithm. Main file is 'AStarAlgorithm.cpp'.
- Algorithm reads 'NeighborhoodMatrix.txt' file first and create neighborhood matrix.
- After this read 'HeuristicValues.txt'.
- After read 'StartAndEndNodeNumber.txt', start node and end node are determined.
- Algorithm creates graph structure finally, and call AStar function.
